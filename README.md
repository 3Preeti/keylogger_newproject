# Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security Internship

This repository contains the code, documentation, and insights from my summer internship project focused on **Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security** with a specialization in keylogger development and detection.

---


## Project Overview

The project explored the development, functionality, and ethical implications of keyloggersâ€”a tool that records keystrokes on a system. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of keylogging mechanisms, their applications in cybersecurity, and strategies to mitigate the risks they pose.

---

### Key Objectives

1. Develop a Python-based keylogger capable of recording keystrokes and saving them in various formats.
2. Understand the working of hardware and software keyloggers.
3. Explore methods for detecting and preventing keylogger infections.
4. Discuss the ethical implications of keylogger usage.


---


## Features

- **Keylogger Development**:
  - Implements keystroke logging using Python's `pynput` library.
  - Saves logs in both JSON and plain text formats for analysis.
- **Controlled Environment Testing**:
  - Safe execution in an isolated setup to ensure ethical compliance.
- **Detection and Prevention**:
  - Discusses common detection techniques like signature analysis and behavior monitoring.
  - Suggests prevention measures, including endpoint security protocols.

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repository>.git

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pynput

3. Run the keylogger in a secure environment
   ```bash
   python keylogger.py

## Ethical Considerations

- This project is intended solely for educational purposes.
- All development and testing were conducted in controlled, ethical environments.
- Unauthorized use of keyloggers to capture personal data is illegal and unethical.


---


## Results

- Effectiveness: The keylogger accurately captured keystrokes, including special keys, and 
   stored them securely.
- Detection: Highlighted limitations of traditional antivirus software in detecting 
  sophisticated keyloggers.
- Prevention: Demonstrated the importance of user education and multi-layered security 
  strategies.
